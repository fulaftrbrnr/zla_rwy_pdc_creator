# zla_rwy_pdc_creator
Modifies config files to add "EXP RWY XX" PDCs
**vSTARS:** Just drop the exe into the same directory as your vSTARS config file (usually ../vSTARS/vSTARSConfig.xml) (must be named "vSTARSConfig.xml") and run it. It creates a backup before modifying, so no fear of lost data due to bugs/errors.
**VRC:** Just drop the exe into the same directory as your VRC alias file (must be named "alias_zla.txt") and run it. It creates a backup before modifying, so no fear of lost data due to bugs/errors.
**vERAM:** Idk someone send me a vERAM config file and I'll do the thing.
